# calculator

I believe that this project is easy with what i know right now so i will focus
more in how to make this look good, so wish me luck.

So it took me like a week because i wanted to do really good, so i have good 
and bad notices, the good things is that i really learn how much array can be 
usefull to this types of projects where the person can storeges so many diferents
patterns, so the bad ones i know that i can resolve but i believe that in the 
future i will be able to understand better this problems and i want to continue,
so my two problems are the next

1)if someone type two or more times consecutive the result will be "NaN"
2)I wanted that the overflow text to go to the left like the calculator of google
but i don't know how to do it for now

So the first problem i can fix it with conditionals but the second problem i expect that in some point of my learning processes i learn how to do it, and when i learn it i will come back.
